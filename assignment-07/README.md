While browsing the web, I have come across numerous different forms. For the
purpose of this assignment, I will specifically discuss searchbox and text
entry forms. The searchbox forms I will be focusing on are the search bars that
are found at the top of many clothing websites; these searchbox forms serve the
purpose of allowing a user to search any available products on their website.
The text entry forms I will be focusing on are those found when you create an
account on a clothing website; these text entry forms serve the purpose of
collecting a users email and protected password, creating a user account, and
putting that users email information into the clothing websites' user database.

These forms serve the purpose of collecting data and information from users.
