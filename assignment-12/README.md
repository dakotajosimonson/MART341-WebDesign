What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?

  Padding is the amount of space between the inner content of the element and the element itself. The margin is the space between the box/element and other elements, or the edge of the parent element. Borders define either an entire box or each side of a box individually, borders differ from margin and padding in that the border portions of a box can be separately colored, and has multiple style options. Compared to margin and padding, borders are more of a visual styling tool, than a space management tool.

What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?

  I am finding that I am having the most trouble with styling in the css stylesheet, instead of doing inline styling. It has been hard to transition from inline styling, which we used for the first 9ish weeks, to now trying to style mostly in the css style sheet.
