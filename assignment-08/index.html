      Lyrics
    </h1>
    <p>
      Yeah <br />
      Used to wanna be a super hero <br />
      Fly around with a cape catching bad guys <br />
      Now my head underwater <br />
      But I ain't in the shower and I ain't getting baptised <br />
      To the good and the bad times <br />
      All the cuts, broken bones and the black eyes <br />
      Young motherfucker with a mad mind <br />
      Made a couple million off of rap lines <br />
       <br />
      Y'all can't tell me nothing no more <br />
      Came from the basement under that floor <br />
      Don't come close, y'all don't even know I'm the GOAT <br />
      Y'all don't even know how I go 'cause I know what you want <br />
      All I wanna do is the most <br />
      Backflip off the rope, sky hook when I'm in the post <br />
      Yeah my girl too clutch to choke (hmm) <br />
      And I ain't calling it quits <br />
      You can build a wall with your bricks <br />
      I like you talking that shit, it's like this <br />
       <br />
      Liquor still in my cup, get faded when I wake up <br />
      'Cause everything is too much, so what? <br />
      Woke up this morning with a bright idea <br />
      Maybe I can exist forever right here <br />
      (Let it run, yeah) <br />
       <br />
      Okay, okay, well I'ma be here for a while <br />
      Longer than I did expect to <br />
      I was out of town, getting lost 'til I was rescued <br />
      Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel <br />
      But I never run out of jet fuel <br />
      Well I'ma be here for a while, longer than I did expect to <br />
      I was out of town, getting lost 'til I was rescued <br />
      Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel <br />
      But I never run out of jet fuel <br />
       <br />
      Hundred-twenty on a car that I don't whip <br />
      I don't even pull it up the driveway <br />
      Throwing up shots like I don't miss <br />
      Never put a limit on the high stakes <br />
      Try to pull my card tell them "Go Fish" <br />
      You ain't gonna find a lie in my face <br />
      I pick it up and let it go quick <br />
      They wanna get p- (uh, oh) <br />
       <br />
      Yeah I don't say nothing that I don't know <br />
      Jumping out the womb wearing Polo <br />
      Everybody wanna jump in <br />
      But I'm old school, lone wolf, take em off solo, yeah <br />
       <br />
      I don't need nobody (I don't need nobody) <br />
      I don't need to be nobody (I don't need to be nobody) <br />
      I'm just doing my thing <br />
      Kick it at the crib, I don't see nobody, no <br />
      So over there with that bullshit <br />
      We don't need it on this side <br />
      I'm pulling up in that new shit <br />
      You always whipping that dick ride <br />
       <br />
      I demand your respect <br />
      I won't share my connect (no) <br />
      Let's get this clear, I am here <br />
      I don't care who got next, young vet <br />
      Feeling like they forget, I let this slide, this time <br />
      Like 25 years I've been high and no less <br />
      Shit, I know I don't guess <br />
      Rather glow, I won't stress <br />
      Better say that shit with your chest <br />
       <br />
      Okay, okay, well I'ma be here for a while <br />
      Longer than I did expect to <br />
      I was out of town, getting lost 'til I was rescued <br />
      Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel <br />
      But I never run out of jet fuel <br />
      Well I'ma be here for a while longer than I did expect to <br />
      I was out of town, getting lost 'til I was rescued <br />
      Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel <br />
      But I never run out of jet fuel <br />
       <br />
      Fate in your hands <br />
      While you're waitin' for me <br />
      I'm already there <br />
      Already, dear <br />
      Now is only now <br />
      Head back to the ground, dear <br />
